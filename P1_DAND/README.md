# Bay Area Bike Share Analysis
This project is an assignment of the Udacity [Nanodegree Data Analyst](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002).

##Project Overview
Bay Area Bike Share is a company that provides on-demand bike rentals for customers in San Francisco, Redwood City, Palo Alto, Mountain View, and San Jose. Users can unlock bikes from a variety of stations throughout each city, and return them to any station within the same city. Users pay for the service either through a yearly subscription or by purchasing 3-day or 24-hour passes. Users can make an unlimited number of trips, with trips under thirty minutes in length having no additional charge; longer trips will incur overtime fees.
The data can be found [here](http://www.bayareabikeshare.com/open-data).

This is **my first** data analysis with _python_. So the project starts with first thoughts and questions about the data and then answers those questions with help of _pandas_ and _numpy_

##Run
